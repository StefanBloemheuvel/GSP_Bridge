# Graph Signal Processing on Complex Networks for Structural Health Monitoring
code and website for the paper under review. [PAGE IN PROGRESS]

## Abstract
In this work, we demonstrate the application of a framework targeting \emph{Complex Networks} and \emph{Graph Signal Processing} (GSP) for \emph{Structural Health Monitoring} (SHM). 
By modeling and analyzing a large bridge equipped with strain and vibration sensors, we show that GSP is capable of selecting the most important sensors, investigating different optimization techniques for selection. Furthermore, GSP enables the detection of graph signal patterns (mode shapes), grasping the physical function of the sensors in the network. 
%For the sampling, several optimization techniques to select the best set of sensors are utilized, of which the top-down hill climber performs best. 
%In the case of mode shape investigation, we identify several mode shapes in the data. 
Our results indicate the efficacy of GSP on complex sensor data modeled in complex networks.
